        We are a group of students from West Windsor-Plainsboro High School South looking to enhance
        the technological literacy of our community by lending a hand to whomever is in need of tech
        help. The Tech Desk operates in the Media Center throughout the day, including lunch and
        even after school while the library is open. Other than simply showing up to the library,
        volunteers are proactive in helping peers, including other library volunteers. Occasionally,
        the club partners with other clubs to build websites and holds workshops with new gadgets to
        be tinkered with. With programming and the internet in general so prevalent today,
        especially now that more students have access to technology through chromebooks in their
        daily lives, the HSS Tech Desk aims to dispel any technological doubts anyone may have.
        The HSS Tech Desk is actively involved in the school community, actively developing sites
        for fellow student-run organizations or even the district itself. More projects to be added later!
